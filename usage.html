        Welcome!
        A quick rundown of how this application works, before you return.<br><br>
        First off. It appears to only work on Microsoft Edge unfortunately.<br>
        Chrome was having massive challenges with the multi-field values. So when using<br>
        voice capture to record the nth element, all previously recorded elements were<br>
        overwritten with the new data. Webstorm suggested edge and it worked so, here we are.<br><br>

        Each text-field will activate recording upon clicking into it.<br>
        Upon clicking out of a field, or to another field, that field stops recording.<br><br>

        Upon submit, the application will read-back what it captured, or if you did<br>
        not speak but choose to put in text, then the text will be spoken back.<br><br>

        That's it. Simple as can be. The info button, if you haven't clicked it, speaks<br>
        some information such as my name, and some class info.<br>
